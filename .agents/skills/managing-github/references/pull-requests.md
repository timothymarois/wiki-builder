# GitHub pull requests

## Discover the pull-request contract

Read applicable repository instructions, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, pull-request templates, and workflows
that define required checks. Inspect templates on the default branch and preserve the matching
template's headings, order, questions, checklists, and footer. Remove comments and placeholders;
support each checked claim with evidence from the exact head.

Map the target repository and branch destination to explicit remotes:

```sh
git remote get-url <base-remote>
git remote get-url <push-remote>
```

Resolve the base from repository rules or the default branch. Confirm the current branch is not the
base or an unrelated worktree. If the worktree is dirty, determine which changes belong to the
request before proceeding. Never hide, discard, or rewrite changes to make a branch appear ready.

Check for an existing pull request from the same branch and owner:

```sh
gh pr list --repo <owner/repo> --state all --head <branch> \
  --json number,state,url,title,headRepositoryOwner
```

`--head` takes the branch name in this listing. Inspect `headRepositoryOwner` before deciding whether
to update an existing pull request or open another.

## Inspect the review range

Fetch the selected base and inspect the merge-base range reviewers will receive:

```sh
git fetch <base-remote> <base>
git log --oneline <base-remote>/<base>..HEAD
git diff --stat <base-remote>/<base>...HEAD
git diff --check <base-remote>/<base>...HEAD
git diff <base-remote>/<base>...HEAD
```

Confirm one coherent outcome, no credentials or generated clutter, no unrelated edits, and no
unexplained change outside the accepted boundary. Run repository-required validation. Report only
checks observed for the current head and name each required check that remains unrun.

## Separate review judgment from hosted review state

Use the applicable technical review workflow to inspect the diff for defects, regressions, security,
and maintainability. This GitHub workflow owns the hosted pull-request context around that judgment:
the explicit repository and pull request, base and head, template compliance, requested reviewers,
existing reviews, check state, and any authorized review submission.

Inspect the current hosted state before calling a pull request ready or deciding what kind of review
is appropriate:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --json url,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,isDraft,reviewDecision,reviewRequests,reviews,statusCheckRollup
gh pr checks <number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

Do not infer code quality from a filled template, green checks, or an existing approval. Conversely,
do not submit a GitHub review merely because a technical reviewer returned findings: confirm the
review applies to the pull request's current head, sanitize the body, and require authority for the
exact `comment`, `approve`, or `request changes` effect.

Record the current `headRefOid`, submit a prepared review body from a file, and select exactly one
decision:

```sh
gh pr review <number> --repo <owner/repo> --comment --body-file <review.md>
gh pr review <number> --repo <owner/repo> --approve --body-file <review.md>
gh pr review <number> --repo <owner/repo> --request-changes --body-file <review.md>
```

After submission, read `reviews`, `latestReviews`, `reviewDecision`, and the current head OID back.
Verify the stored author, decision, and body, and confirm the head still equals the recorded OID. If
the head changed, report that the technical judgment may be stale; do not silently resubmit or
change the decision.
Requesting or removing reviewers, dismissing a review, resolving threads, merging, or enabling
auto-merge are separate mutations and require their own authority.

## Write the merge case

A pull-request body is a **scan map for a reviewer**, not an implementation diary. A reviewer decides
in under a minute whether to read the diff and what to watch for. Write for that minute.

**Budget: aim for 200 words, hard-stop at 400 outside code blocks.** Past that, a body stops being
read and becomes something scrolled. Use the repository template when one applies; otherwise the
[fallback template](pull-request-template.md).

Per section:

| Section | Budget | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| Problem | 1-2 sentences | What is wrong now and what it costs. No history. |
| Solution | 3-6 bullets, one line each | One decision per bullet. Non-obvious rationale only. |
| Evidence | 2-4 items | Numbers, output, before/after. Only what the diff cannot show. |
| Acceptance / Validation | a checklist | Command and observed result. No prose. |

**If a reviewer can see it in the diff, do not write it.** No changed-file inventories, no
restatement of the request, no narration of how the work went, no "as expected", no summarising a
function the reviewer is about to read.

Prefer a bullet, a table, or a two-line code block over a paragraph. Never write three paragraphs
where three bullets do. Cut every sentence that survives being deleted. One idea per bullet, and no
bullet that only exists to introduce the next.

State risk and incompatibility in **one bolded line** each, where a reviewer cannot miss it — a
breaking change buried in paragraph four has not been communicated. Link deeper artifacts rather than
pasting algorithms, logs, or chronology.

Delete generic filler and claims such as "works as expected". Preserve a repository's required
identity block; with none, append nothing.

Never mark a commit, branch, or pull request as machine-authored: no provider, model, tool, session,
vendor link, generated-by footer, agent identity block, robot emoji, or provider-style co-author
trailer. The work is judged on the diff, not on who typed it. Follow the repository title convention;
use an imperative title only when no convention exists.

Reconcile every issue named by the assignment or pull request before opening, updating, or merging
the pull request:

- If the exact head satisfies the issue's acceptance criteria and targets the default branch, put
  one full closing reference such as `Closes #123` in the body. A bare issue URL, `#123`, `Refs`, or
  `Related` does not close the issue.
- If the pull request is partial, targets a staging base, or leaves any acceptance criterion unmet,
  use `Refs #123` or `Related to #123`. State the unmet outcome in the body and explicitly report
  that the issue will remain open; do not present the issue as completed.
- If the relationship is unclear, read the issue and compare every acceptance criterion with the
  exact head. Do not omit the link or choose a closing keyword from the title alone.

Before an authorized merge, inspect `closingIssuesReferences` and confirm it matches that issue
disposition. After a default-branch merge, read each completed issue back and require `state: CLOSED`;
if GitHub did not close it, report the mismatch and correct it only when issue closure is authorized.

## Open, update, and verify

Recheck repository, base, head, review range, template, validation, and authority immediately before
mutation. Use a body file:

```sh
git push -u <push-remote> <branch>
gh pr create --repo <owner/repo> \
  --base <base> \
  --head <branch> \
  --title '<title>' \
  --body-file <pull-request-body.md> \
  [--draft]
```

For a user-owned fork, qualify the head as `<user>:<branch>`. GitHub CLI does not support an
organization name in that qualified form. Stop rather than opening from a different repository.

For an existing pull request, inspect it before `gh pr edit` and change only requested fields. Do not
add reviewers, assignees, projects, labels, merge queues, or merge settings without specific
authority.

Read the stored pull request and checks:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --json url,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,headRepository,headRepositoryOwner,isDraft,closingIssuesReferences,latestReviews,reviewDecision,reviews
gh pr checks <number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

Verify repository, base, head, owner, title, body, template, identity, privacy, draft state, closing
links, and URL. Report pending or failing checks; creation alone is not merge readiness.

## Merge an already-ready pull request

Take the direct path when the current request authorizes the merge and the pull request is already
ready: it is not a draft, the same recorded `headRefOid` has passed the repository's required
validation and CI, required reviews and issue disposition are resolved, the privacy inspection is
complete, and no finding or uncertainty remains. Evidence stays current while that exact head stays
current. Reconfirm its stored state; do not rerun local validation or technical review merely
because execution has reached the merge step.

Do not delegate, reopen implementation, create a new plan or task brief, or add an unrequired review
or test solely because an already-ready pull request reached the merge step. Immediately before
merging, read the stored gate state and require the head OID to remain unchanged. Use
`--match-head-commit` so GitHub refuses the merge if the reviewed head moves between that check and
the mutation:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --json url,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,closingIssuesReferences,statusCheckRollup
gh pr checks <number> --repo <owner/repo>
gh pr merge <number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --squash \
  --match-head-commit <recorded-head-oid>
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --json url,state,mergedAt,headRefOid,mergeCommit,closingIssuesReferences
```

Use the repository's required `--merge`, `--rebase`, or `--squash` method; the example uses squash.
Afterward, read the pull request back and verify `state: MERGED`, `mergedAt`, the original head OID,
the merge commit, and any completed issue state. If the head changed, a required check or review is
not satisfied, the merge is refused, or authority is incomplete, report the exact failed gate and stop.
Do not turn merge execution into a new correction or review cycle without authority for that work.

## Clean up after merge

Treat cleanup as the final part of an authorized merge. Read the stored pull request again and
require `state: MERGED`, a non-empty `mergedAt`, and its exact `headRefName` and `headRefOid`. This
stored result is the merge proof for squash and rebase merges too; ancestry alone cannot prove
those outcomes.

Delete a branch only when it is the disposable, task-scoped head created for that merged pull
request, such as a feature, fix, documentation, or chore branch. Never delete the default branch,
the pull-request base, a protected branch, a production or deployment branch, a release branch, a
shared development or integration branch, an active or unmerged pull-request head, or any branch
whose purpose or ownership is unclear. A familiar name is not enough to classify a branch as
disposable.

Before deletion, prove the local and remote refs still point at the recorded `headRefOid` and
inspect every worktree holding the branch:

```sh
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> \
  --json state,mergedAt,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid
git worktree list --porcelain
git rev-parse refs/heads/<head>
git ls-remote --heads <push-remote> refs/heads/<head>
```

If either ref moved after merge, stop instead of deleting new work. If the head is checked out in
the main worktree, switch that checkout to the updated base before deleting it. If it has a linked
worktree, require a clean status and remove that exact worktree with `git worktree remove`; never
force-remove an unclean or locked worktree. Then delete the exact local and remote head refs:

```sh
git switch <base>
git merge --ff-only <base-remote>/<base>
git branch -D <head>
git push <push-remote> --delete <head>
```

`-D` is justified here only because the stored merged pull request and exact head OID already prove
the disposable ref is complete; a squash merge is not an ancestor of the updated base. Do not use
`gh pr merge --delete-branch` blindly because it skips this branch-role, ref, and worktree review.

Finally, verify the local listing and remote query return no matching ref. Report preserved
long-lived branches and any cleanup withheld because a guard failed.
